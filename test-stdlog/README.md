This was just a test I run to see the overhead generated by creating a logger using Go's standard log library for every log message. The code spawns a number of different threads that each print the same number of messages, and does this once using fmt and once using [my custom](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/stdlog) logging package. It turns out that the difference is insignificant and has determined me to stick with my approach.

Sample written message:

```
[info] 2023/02/17 20:23:59 [something]
```

Sample runs 1000 threads, 100 messages per thread (after reboot, which seems to have sped up the execution by 10 seconds...):

```
printalot: 10.6862847s, logalot: 9.8260375s
printalot: 9.5667713s, logalot: 9.7314287s
printalot: 9.7145407s, logalot: 9.7401294s
```

Sample run 1000 threads, 1000 messages per thread:

```
printalot: 2m54.368541s, logalot: 3m0.1742913s (prior to reboot)
printalot: 1m36.3145282s, logalot: 1m42.8952609s (after reboot)
```
